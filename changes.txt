I made following changes(04/05/2021)
1)LiveFaceRecognition.py
-security layer added to get better result of face recogmition
- make different functions which can be used in face recognition
- seperate database process & face recognition

2)routes.py
def on_camera():
- add database layer to add attendance
- mark attendance only of those students who have same division & same sem of current lecture

3)__init__.py
- load all types of pretrained model here


Observations:
1) Where is the name/enrollment of Todays attendance in faculty
2) If you are applying 5 days TT then you have to change total days accordingly
3) total attendance student side should show total attendance subject wise
4) db can be copy so we can reduce our hardwork
5) showing error in downloading pdf

other ideas:
1) We can add "lectures" page at faculty side so faculty can see only their lectures with timings, sem, div, subject
