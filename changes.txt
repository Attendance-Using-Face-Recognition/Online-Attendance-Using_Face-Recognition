other ideas:
1) We can add "lectures" page at faculty side so faculty can see only their lectures with timings, sem, div, subject - done

1)Merge "Add lecture" & "My lectures" in new tab "lectures" in navbar
2)Showing actual days +1 day in total days of attendance -see UGC CN in  4th-H

Admin functionalities ideas (priority vise):
- can verify faculty, reject or accept
- can see/download any sem's attendance
- add term start & term end
- can see overall time-table
- can add slots & timings it can be change dynamically
