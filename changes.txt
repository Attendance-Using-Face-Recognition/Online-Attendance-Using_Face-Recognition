I made following changes(05/05/2021) -- Modifier : Smit

1)routes.py

def student_total_attendance:
- Fixed total attendance problem 
- Now showing subject wise total attended class out of total taken classes since term start

def add-lecture:
- Added such security that only one lecture can be done for one slot for particular sem and division
- Also Faculty can not add their already booked slot with another class (I know it's bit rigid)

def faculty-attendance :
- Fixed problem of repeating same students multiple times

def faculty_total_attendance:
- Added get_pdf function to get pdf of attendance 
- Added get_excel function to get excel sheet of attendance since term start to till today 
- Fixed Problem of layout of attendance by giving such details of students

templates:
- Changes some layout of attendance pages of students and faculties



other ideas:
1) We can add "lectures" page at faculty side so faculty can see only their lectures with timings, sem, div, subject


Observations:
1) Where is the name/enrollment of Todays attendance in faculty : Done
2) If you are applying 5 days TT then you have to change total days accordingly : Done
3) total attendance student side should show total attendance subject wise : Done
4) db can be copy so we can reduce our hardwork 
5) showing error in downloading pdf : Done (It was because of overridden of methods of 2 different classes)
